RepeatReads: Track and analyse multi-mapped reads across repeat elements.
}
\description{
R/Bioconductor package for the analysis and de-convolutions of multi-mapping short read data in the context of repeat element. Provides functions for tracking classes and families of repeat elements associated with a single read. Furthermore performs randomized assignment of short reads to single location in genome if certain conditions are met, e.g. short read aligns to only one class and family of repeat element [ToDo]. Interfaces with existing packages for peak calling [ToDo].
